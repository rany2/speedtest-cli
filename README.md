# speedtest-cli

Command line interface for testing internet bandwidth using
speedtest.net

## Versions

speedtest-cli works with Python 3.6-3.12

## Installation

### Github

    pip install git+https://github.com/rany2/speedtest-cli.git

or

    git clone https://github.com/rany2/speedtest-cli.git
    cd speedtest-cli
    python setup.py install

### Just download (Like the way it used to be)

    wget -O speedtest-cli https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rany2/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py
    chmod +x speedtest-cli

or

    curl -Lo speedtest-cli https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rany2/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py
    chmod +x speedtest-cli

## Usage

```

                    [--share] [--simple] [--csv] [--csv-delimiter CSV_DELIMITER]
                    [--csv-header] [--json] [--list] [--limit LIMIT]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --no-download         Do not perform download test
  --no-upload           Do not perform upload test
  --single              Only use a single connection instead of multiple. This
                        simulates a typical file transfer.
  --bytes               Display values in bytes instead of bits. Does not affect
                        the image generated by --share, nor output from --json or
                        --csv
  --share               Generate and provide a URL to the speedtest.net share
                        results image, not displayed with --csv
  --simple              Suppress verbose output, only show basic information
  --csv                 Suppress verbose output, only show basic information in CSV
                        format. Speeds listed in bit/s and not affected by --bytes
  --csv-delimiter CSV_DELIMITER
                        Single character delimiter to use in CSV output. Default
                        ","
  --csv-header          Print CSV headers
  --json                Suppress verbose output, only show basic information in
                        JSON format. Speeds listed in bit/s and not affected by
                        --bytes
  --list                Display a list of speedtest.net servers sorted by distance
  --limit LIMIT         Maximum number of servers to get. Default 10
  --server SERVER       Specify a server ID to test against. Can be supplied
                        multiple times
  --search [SEARCH ...]
                        Search for a server with the provided string in the name
  --exclude EXCLUDE     Exclude a server from selection. Can be supplied multiple
                        times
  --source SOURCE       Source IP address to bind to
  --timeout TIMEOUT     HTTP timeout in seconds. Default 5
  --no-verify           Do not verify SSL certs. Default True
  --no-pre-allocate     Do not pre allocate upload data. Pre allocation is enabled
                        by default to improve upload performance. To support
                        systems with insufficient memory, use this option to avoid
                        a MemoryError
  --version             Show the version number and exit
```

## Inconsistency

It is not a goal of this application to be a reliable latency reporting
tool.

Latency reported by this tool should not be relied on as a value
indicative of ICMP style latency. It is a relative value used for
determining the lowest latency server for performing the actual speed
test against.

There is the potential for this tool to report results inconsistent with
Speedtest.net. There are several concepts to be aware of that factor
into the potential inconsistency:

1.  Speedtest.net has migrated to using pure socket tests instead of
    HTTP based tests
2.  This application is written in Python
3.  Different versions of Python will execute certain parts of the code
    faster than others
4.  CPU and Memory capacity and speed will play a large part in
    inconsistency between Speedtest.net and even other machines on the
    same network

Issues relating to inconsistencies will be closed as wontfix and without
additional reason or context.
